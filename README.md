# Fun Calculator 🎉

A simple and fun calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

## Features ✨
- Takes two numbers as input (supports decimals)
- Performs four basic operations:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## How to Use 🚀
1. Run the Python script
2. Enter the first number when prompted
3. Enter the second number when prompted
4. The program will display:
   - Sum of the numbers
   - Difference between the numbers
   - Product of the numbers
   - Quotient of the numbers

## Important Notes ⚠️
- The program uses `float()` to handle decimal numbers
- Division by zero will cause an error (no safeguards implemented)
- Designed for simple arithmetic operations only

## Example Usage 💻
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2

Results:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Requirements 📋
- Python 3.x

## Limitations 🛑
- No error handling for non-numeric inputs
- No protection against division by zero
- Basic functionality only

Enjoy calculating! 😎✨
